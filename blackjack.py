Blackjack rules:
All players get 2 cards, including the dealer, however one of the dealers cards is turned face up.
In casinos dealers have to play until they hit 16+ as a hard hand.
*If you get 2 of the same card you have the option to split into 2 different hands?

Initial options: 1st Bet.
when it's the players turn they can either:
stand or hit
maybe split their hands too but idk about that one

after all players stand or go bust the dealer has to play.

then the payout happens.


Special rules:
21 = natural or blackjack = tie with dealer or win 
(^ if dealer doesn't have blackjack then the payouts are 3:2 instead of 1:1)
CHECK (dealer has blackjack then bets remain in the box and you play again?)
if a player has 5 cards they win

# Card class: getValue shouldn't be in the card class since the value the cards have depends on what game is played
# Card container class looks fine
# Class hand maybe should be renamed to like blackjack hand and moved in the blackjack file?
# class deck looks fine


# should we just have an engine which already contains everything? like a blackjack function in hand and what not?
# or different py files for different games? more elegant?
